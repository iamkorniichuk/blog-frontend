  <h2>Who are We</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a one-person effort — just me, a developer who enjoys turning everyday
    programming problems into clear, practical tutorials. Everything I publish here comes from real
    issues I’ve faced in my own work. I provide quick copy-paste solutions at the top of each page,
    and if you want to dive deeper, the main article explains how everything works.

  <h2>Contacts</h2>
  <p>
    I have not set up official contact channels yet, but I plan to soon. For now, you can stay tuned
    for new tutorials or updates on this site.
